  - Always create PRs against the staging branch (use --base staging)
  - Never add signature to PR descriptions
  - Follow the staged deployment flow: feature → staging → main
  - All tests should validate OUR system, configuration, and code - never test established libraries or external platforms (e.g., don't test GitHub's API, test our repo config; don't test FastAPI's features, test our endpoints)
